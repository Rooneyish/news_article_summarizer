The Tories and Lib Dems appear determined to force a Commons vote on the issue within months, leaving Labour out in the cold by opposing the move. David Cameron vowed to publish proposals on English votes for English laws before Christmas, saying yesterday the case was now \\u2018unanswerable\\u2019. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured, said he was about to publish proposals for English votes on English laws . However, the move prompted a fierce row over whether to ban Scots from voting on income tax rates. A report by the cross-party Smith Commission, published yesterday, set out a new deal for Scotland following its rejection of independence that will see Holyrood control income tax, VAT revenues, air passenger duty and the power to introduce new benefits. The package will transform Holyrood into one of the world\\u2019s most powerful devolved parliaments. Lord Smith of Kelvin chaired the Commission\\u00a0set up in the wake of the independence referendum in September . But within hours, the resurgent Scottish Nationalists suggested it was not good enough and Scotland\\u2019s new First Minister Nicola Sturgeon complained of \\u2018continued Westminster rule\\u2019. The settlement also prompted turmoil at Westminster, with Labour split over the implications of English home rule, under which Scots MPs would be prevented from voting on measures that only apply to the rest of the UK. The party could be permanently hobbled if its 40 Scottish MPs are stripped of the right to vote on issues controlled by the Scottish Parliament such as tax, welfare, health and education. And there are doubts over whether an MP in a Scottish seat could ever again be Prime Minister or Chancellor, as they would have only a limited say over proposed legislation. Mr Cameron said he was \\u2018delighted\\u2019 with the Smith Commission report, adding: \\u2018I think the report today also makes the case for English votes for English laws unanswerable and we will be taking action on that shortly.\\u2019 Although the commission included a promise that MPs from across Britain can still vote on a national budget, it became clear yesterday that the Conservatives intend a ban to apply to financial matters that only apply to the rest of the UK. Scots MPs could therefore be excluded from votes on income tax rates \\u2013 which could make it impossible for Labour to introduce its proposed new 50p top rate of tax even if it wins the general election. Mr Cameron\\u2019s spokesman said: \\u2018There is going to continue to be a UK budget. \\u2018Of course there are elements where you have seen devolution on financial matters, and in that respect I would say the principle of English votes for English laws applies. In terms of what is for the UK, that will remain UK-wide.\\u2019 The new powers will be fought over by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Jim Murphy, who is a frontrunner in the race to lead Labour in Scotland . Sir George Young said proposals accentuated a 'constitutional imbalance' between England and the UK . Mr Clegg suggested the Lib Dems also want to curb Scots MPs\\u2019 say over income tax votes. \\u2018We need to look at this issue of how you deal with matters which come up from time to time which only affect England and Wales,\\u2019 he said. Labour accused the other parties of betraying the promise made in the Smith Commission. Mr Miliband said: \\u2018I think it\\u2019s part of the integrity of the UK that it continues to be the place that Scottish MPs vote on the budget.\\u2019 Former Commons leader Sir George Young said the Smith Commission proposals \\u2018further accentuate the imbalance in the British constitution between England and the rest of the United Kingdom\\u2019.And Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said the English \\u2018must have a veto on all laws that largely or exclusively affect them\\u2019. Former Tory cabinet minister John Redwood added: \\u2018Once Scotland is determining her own income tax rates and bands in the Scottish Parliament, it would be quite wrong for Scottish members of this Parliament to be trying to fix those bands and rates for the English.\\u2019 Labour MP Graeme Allen called for speedy solution to prevent a surge in English nationalism. The debate raged as Alex Salmond yesterday picked up an award \\u2013 and pretended to wipe away tears of pride with a hanky designed like a St George\\u2019s flag. The former Scottish first minister mopped up mock tears in London as he was named Spectator magazine\\u2019s Politician of the Year. What new powers mean for Scotland and the rest of us . In the dying days of the referendum campaign, the three main Westminster parties promised Scotland new powers in a bid to prevent a Yes vote. Yesterday, the Smith Commission published its blueprint for implementing the dramatic changes. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines what it means. The Barnett formula . Lord Barnett, pictured, developed a system where Scotland receives more than \\u00a31,600 per head in public spending than England . The system under which Scotland gets \\u00a31,623 more public expenditure per head than England \\u2013 or 19 per cent more \\u2013 survives. If revisions are made, Scotland must not lose out. The funding helps to pay for items such as free prescriptions, not offered in England. Income tax and VAT . Holyrood can spend 100 per cent of income tax collected in Scotland, along with the first 10 per cent of VAT. This would give it around \\u00a315billion a year for devolved matters. Scotland would be expected to try to balance its books, but it does not have to live within its means overall. Over \\u00a365billion was spent north of the border in 2012-13. Only \\u00a353billion was raised through taxes. Tax rates and bands . Holyrood cannot alter the threshold at which tax is paid \\u2013 currently \\u00a310,000 \\u2013 but it could raise or lower both the basic and higher rates or introduce a new tax band. In reality, the SNP is likely to reinstate the 50p tax rate for the better-off, to fund an increase in welfare spending or job creation. It could lead to high-earning Scots domiciling themselves in England. There is also the bureaucratic nightmare of how to treat people who live in Scotland but work in England, or vice versa. Borrowing Powers . Should income tax receipts drop in a recession, Scotland could borrow billions to make up the shortfall \\u2013 with the permission of the Treasury. Holyrood could also borrow to fund capital investment. Ultimately, Westminster would have to step in if things went wrong. The UK Government would be left to bail out The scots . Arguably, the crucial paragraph in the Smith report. Scots get all the benefits of increased independence but very few of the risks. In another financial crash it would again be left to the UK to bail out Scottish banks. Many taxes reserved to Westminster . Including National Insurance, inheritance and capital gains tax, corporation tax, fuel and excise duty. The SNP says 70 per cent of Scottish taxes will still be set at Westminster. In other words, it is not satisfied. The idea that devolving power would end the clamour for independence and preserve the Union has already been proved a nonsense. MPs From across the UK will decide the UK Budget . With Scots fixing their own income tax levels, there will be demands for Scottish MPs sitting at Westminster not to vote on tax policy in the rest of the UK. This could leave a Labour government that needed Scottish MPs to form a majority unable to pass its own Budget \\u2013 an untenable position. English votes for English laws . The issue is ignored. But there is no way Tory MPs will not demand constitutional changes to stop Scots voting on devolved matters. The State pension . The UK \\u2013 not the Scottish taxpayer \\u2013 remains on the hook for the most expensive welfare spending. This includes basic and additional state pensions, and most of the benefits included in the new Universal Credit. Devolved benefits . Housing benefit, Disability Living Allowance, cold weather payments and winter fuel payments are all devolved, giving Holyrood the power to axe the so-called bedroom tax. The benefit cap could be set at a higher rate for Scots than in the rest of the UK. The Smith Commission is setting out dramatic new powers for Scotland, ordered in the wake of the referendum on independence which saw Scotland vote to stay in the UK . 16 and 17-year-olds could get the vote . For Westminster elections, the age will remain 18. But Labour and the Lib Dems are committed to giving 16-year-olds the vote for UK general elections \\u2013 so the genie may already be out of the bottle. Air duty devolved. Rail could be nationalised . Holyrood could axe tax on air passengers \\u2013 so Scottish airports could undercut English rivals. Public sector will be able to bid for rail contracts. Scots help to agree UK\\u2019s stance in EU discussion of devolved matters . If the Tories win the election, this may be a headache for Mr Cameron in referendum negotiations with Brussels. He will have to haggle not only with other member states, but also with a pro-EU SNP Government. Consultation to take place on devolving abortion law . Abortion is legal in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. A rule change in Scotland could see women crossing the border \\u2013 in either direction \\u2013 for the procedure. Some now travel here from Northern Ireland, where it is mostly illegal. Licensing of onshore gas and oil devolved . Could mean fracking goes on across rest of the UK while Scotland is largely untouched. Offshore gas and oil receipts still go to Westminster.\",\n          \"Dozens of loaded firearms, inert military grenades, a mobile phone disguised as a stun gun and a tiny lipstick knife were among the prohibited items seized from travellers at US airports last month. In the latest round-up on its blog, the Transportation Security Administration announced that it had confiscated 196 guns at security checkpoints in October. Almost all of the firearms - 171 in total - were loaded and over a dozen had rounds chambered. Nearly 200 guns were seized from travellers at security checkpoints at US airports in October, the TSA says . Packing heat: Of those seized, 171 were loaded and over a dozen had rounds chambered . Virtually all cases involve a pistol-packing passenger who had no ill intent and forgot to remove the firearm from their hand luggage before it was submitted for screening. But even forgetful passengers risk being arrested and assessed a penalty of $7,500 (nearly \\u00a35,000). In addition to guns, TSA agents continue to find inert or replica grenades and other weaponry in passengers\\u2019 luggage on a weekly basis, despite repeated warnings. Last week alone they seized ammunition, a cane sword, a box cutter blade concealed in the lining of a carry-on bag in Boston, 16 stun guns and four inert or realistic replica grenades at airports in Atlanta, New Orleans, Des Moines, Iowa, and Springfield, Missouri. Confiscated: TSA officers say they continue to find inert and replica grenades in passengers' luggage . A 13-inch cane sword was found in a passenger's luggage at Charlotte Douglas International Airport . A passenger attempted to board a plane in Honolulu with a military training kit, including inert C-4 explosives . TSA officers intercepted an unloaded cannon barrel at Kahului Airport in Hawaii . And it appears many travellers are unaware that novelty items that look like bombs or grenades are also prohibited. The discovery of such items can lead to significant delays because bomb experts must be brought in to make sure the objects do not pose a threat. Earlier this month a passenger at Honolulu\\u2019s airport checked a bag containing a military training kit with inert C-4 explosives, blasting caps, detonators and a detonating cord. The airport\\u2019s baggage room had to be evacuated while bomb experts inspected the kit, resulting in a delay for screening. One of the more unusual items to be discovered by TSA officers was an unloaded cannon barrel at Kahului Airport in Hawaii. Last week, 34 of 41 guns seized at American airports were loaded, according to the TSA . A lipstick knife was discovered in luggage at Detroit Metro Airport . Shocking: TSA officers seized a stun gun that was disguised as a mobile phone . A collection of knives seized at US airports in October . In its blog, the TSA urged passengers to leave the items at home to avoid being arrested or causing delays. The government agency said: \\u2018Just because we find a prohibited item on an individual does not mean they had bad intentions, that's for the law enforcement officer to decide. 'In many cases, people simply forgot they had these items.'\",\n          \"Pensacola, Florida (CNN) -- The man who prosecutors said captained a team of masked men dressed as ninjas as they ambushed a Florida home has been found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder. A Escambia County jury determined Thursday evening that Leonard Gonzalez Jr. followed through on his plan and fatally shot Byrd and Melanie Billings in the couple's master bedroom, as one of their nine special-needs children looked on. He was also found guilty of armed home-invasion robbery. During the trial, Gonzalez frequently conversed with his attorneys, shook his head and even smirked. He told Judge Nickolas Geeker that he didn't need to call any witnesses or testify on his own behalf, because \\\"the evidence speaks for itself.\\\" And after the jury came out to ask a question during their four hours of deliberations, he said, \\\"I've already been tried and convicted by the media.\\\" But Gonzalez was stoic just before the verdict came in. Meanwhile, members of the Billings family cried in the courtroom, with Byrd's and Melanie's daughter Ashley Markham hugging prosecutors. Gonzalez nodded to the Billings family -- as he'd done earlier Thursday -- after he was fingerprinted and led away. The jury of 11 women and one man deliberated for four hours before reaching the verdict. In that time, they requested to see a 14-minute surveillance video, culled from 16 cameras around the Billings house that were set up around the house to watch the nine special-needs children that the couple had adopted and were in the house of the time of the murder. One video showed a masked man -- who Frederick Thornton, a member of the group, identified as Gonzalez -- shooting Byrd Billings once in each leg. Another video showed a scene from a girl's bedroom as a red van packed with people arrives outside the house. The girl gets up from bed as the masked men enter the house, then hides under the covers pretending to sleep after hearing the commotion nearby. The van was owned by Gonzalez. A camera was not in the master bedroom. But Thornton said that Gonzalez led the Billings' couple into the room. And expert witnesseses showed how Gonzalez shot Byrd Billings once in the head and twice more as he lay face down on the floor, and then shot Melanie Billings through the head and chest. During closing arguments, Assistant State Attorney John Molchan painted an involved picture depicting Gonzalez as the ringleader who hatched the plan, formed the team, outfitted six other men with guns and clothes, then led them as they barged into the Billings' large home in Beulah, Florida. He said Gonzalez was motivated by \\\"simple greed\\\" -- pointing to testimony from the defendant's wife that the family's business, a karate school, had gone under and they had dwindling means to take care of their six children. Leonard Gonzalez knew Billings, who gave $5,000 to a self-defense charity he started, and he knew he had money, Molchan said. Gonzalez provided the all-black clothing, boots and guns and briefed the attackers prior to the invasion, according to Molchan. He said that Gonzalez also did \\\"all the talking [and] all the muscling\\\" when the group entered the residence. \\\"The puzzle pieces all come together, and they prove an ugly story,\\\" said Molchan. \\\"There is no doubt that Leonard Patrick Gonzalez is the man who had his finger ... on the trigger.\\\" John Jay Gontarek, one of Gonzalez's attorneys, criticized the state's case as overly reliant on circumstantial evidence and two men, Rakeem Florence and Thornton, who confessed their involvement and named Gonzalez as the leader of the band of masked men and the shooter. Florence said there was no mention anyone would be killed until he overheard Gonzalez say he was \\\"going to kill somebody\\\" minutes before they went to the house. Prosecutors called the testimony of the two -- who were age 16 and 19, respectively, when the crime took place -- measured and reliable, and supported by the other evidence in the case. But both Florence and Thornton, who have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for their roles, admitted first lying to family and law enforcement before changing their stories. \\\"They're hanging their hat on the testimony of those admitted liars,\\\" Gontarek said of the prosecution. DNA tests on the 9 mm pistol and bullet casings that killed the Billings' couple did not conclusively point to Gonzalez, Gontarek pointed out. He said, too, that there was minimal effort to clean the alleged murder weapon. \\\"We don't have to prove who the killer was,\\\" Gontarek said. \\\"No matter how tragic this murder is, if you have one reasonable doubt, then you have a duty to return a verdict of not guilty.\\\" Florence and Thornton testified that Gonzalez said they were after $13 million of money laundered from \\\"the Mexican mafia.\\\" A small safe that was stolen and later found in the back yard of one of Gonzalez's friends contained prescription medication, family documents and some jewelry. Two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN that a second safe at the home contained at least $100,000. In final comments, Molchan reminded the jury of Gonzalez's own words after he first spoke to police, when he reportedly said, \\\"I'm in deep, I'll take the heat.\\\" \\\"The defense attorney labeled [Leonard] Gonzalez as being somewhat goofy,\\\" said Molchan. \\\"Folks, he's not goofy. He's a murderer -- a plain, cold-blooded murderer.\\\" The penalty phase in Gonzalez's trial starts Friday morning, Judge Geeker said.

Doctors believe her potassium levels had plummeted to such a low level that her heart completely stopped. But luckily, two officers, believed to be from the Met Police, rushed to her side and gave Hollie life-saving CPR until an ambulance arrived. She was then rushed to Basildon hospital, where she was put into an induced coma. But the teenager then made an unexpected recovery which stunned medics. She is now recovering at her home in Leigh, Essex, despite her mother Denise Bennett being told to expect the worst. The family are now trying to find the police officers who saved Hollie so they can thank them in person. Hollie said: 'I don't remember much about what happened that day but I owe the doctors and the off-duty officers everything. 'I feel very tired still and I know I have a long recovery ahead. It's been really horrible but I am so thankful to be alive.' Ms Bennett added: 'I would love to be able to meet the police officers who saved my daughter's life and for them to get in touch . 'I really want to thank the two off duty police officers that saved my daughter's life. They are just absolute heroes. 'And also the critical care team at Basildon Hospital - the treatment she received there was brilliant.' The drama unfolded while Hollie was waiting outside the Chiquito's restaurant while her boyfriend Gary Hobbs\\u00a0went to park his car. When he came back, he found Hollie laying on the floor with a crowd gathered around her. Ms Bennett then received a phone call, telling her what had happened. The 17-year-old, who suffers with bulimia, had collapsed because she had a dangerous level of potassium in her body. She is now recovering at home with her mother Denise Bennett (right) Humans need potassium in higher amounts than any other mineral. Adults need around 3,500mg in their body per day. Potassium plays a fundamental role in maintaining the fluid and acid/alkaline balance of the body. It is vital for the transmission of nerve impulses and helps the heart to beat regularly. It also counterbalances sodium in the body, and is known to help lower blood pressure. To get enough you need to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are especially good sources because they also provide a low level of sodium. The Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults (HMSO 1990) showed that the average intake of potassium is 3,187mg in males and 2,434mg in females. Compared with the daily recommendation of 3500mg intakes they are therefore low. People most at risk of marginal potassium include the elderly, athletes and manual workers who sweat out a lot of potassium and people taking certain diuretic drugs. Heavy coffee and alcohol drinkers may lack the mineral and should try to increase their dietary intake. She said: 'Fortunately a young bouncer working at the park had the presence of mind to take her phone and ring me. 'He said to me \\\"your daughter has collapsed and is receiving CPR\\\". I asked if she was responding and he just went quiet and said \\\"no\\\". The drive from Leigh to Basildon was awful. It was terrifying.' Hollie was transferred to Basildon Hospital where doctors told Ms Bennett that her heart had stopped. She had technically died for a short time, they said. The teen was then put into an induced coma. Doctors told Ms Bennett to return in the morning but to prepare for the worst. She said: 'I went home to Hollie's bedroom and was just clutching the coat she had been wearing. I was crying and crying.' But, the next morning, doctors began to bring Hollie out of the coma and she started to breathe on her own. Five days later she was allowed home. Ms Bennett said: 'I really want to warn other young people about the effects of bulimia. 'I know it is an illness but it is beyond my comprehension why these kids do this. It is not a game. It can have life-threatening consequences.' Hollie suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which her mother believes caused her to become depressed and develop bulimia. Doctors believe that Hollie had been so sick that her potassium levels had dropped to a dangerous level.\",\n          \"The Tesla Model S P85D's 'insane mode' may be fast, but a new electric car by Drive eO is set to be even faster. The Latvian firm is currently developing a one megawatt electric race car to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in June. The stomach-churning vehicle, dubbed eO PP03, runs on 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack driving six YASA-400 electric motors. Latvia-based Drive eO has created a vehicle, named eO PP03, which runs on 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that drives six YASA-400 electric motors and produces 1020 kW (1368 horsepower) It is capable of producing 1020 kW (1368 horsepower) and speeds of up to 160 mph (260 km/h), compared to the top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h) on the Model S. Drive eO says it will be the 'first one megawatt all-electric race car with peak torque of 2160 Nm and kerb weight is targeted at 2646lb (1,200kg). The car is still in development and the company has yet to reveal its range. 'We want to become the first overall winner with an electric vehicle,' said Kristaps Dambis, project director at Drive eO. Drive eO was the first to enter and complete the Dakar Rally with a hybrid electric vehicle. That was followed by the creation of eO PP01, a purpose built fully electric prototype race car to participate at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb competition. The one megawatt electric race car is set to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (pictured) in Colorado Springs. The race is the second oldest motor racing event in the US and runs on a challenging 12.42 mile (20km) course with 156 turns in Colorado Springs. All wheel drive .

It begins at 2,862 metre elevation (9,390 feet) and finishes at the 4,301 metre (14,110 feet) summit of the Pikes Peak mountain in Colorado Springs. The announcement of the Drive eO PP03 following the development of software upgrades to make the P85D even faster. 'Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm,' Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted earlier this year. Musk was referring to something known as the 'insane mode' which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in a little over three seconds. The D model, unveiled in October has two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels. It has a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h), compared with the current 130 mph (209 km/h) on Tesla's previous S model. In Insane Mode, the full 691 horsepower of the electric car's two motors is applied in one go. At the launch event, Mr Musk said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from a standstill. During recent tests of the Insane acceleration, also carried out by DragTimes, the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds .\",\n          \"Great-grandmother:\\u00a0Gloria Ross, 84,\\u00a0died following a stroke in hospital \\u2013 after she was ignored by nurses for more than an hour, her distraught family say . A great-grandmother died following a stroke in hospital \\u2013 after she was ignored by nurses for more than an hour, her distraught family say. Gloria Ross, 84, who spent 30 years in the National Health Service as a nurse, was found with a distorted face when she was visited by her grandson Wayne Wilkins, 25. But when he asked nurses at Whipps Cross Hospital, North East London, for help, they said Mrs Ross was \\u2018just tired\\u2019 \\u2013 and told him the senior nurse was \\u2018on a break\\u2019. Mr Wilkins called his mother, Mrs Ross\\u2019 daughter Maxine, 49, who rushed to the hospital and pleaded with nurses to step in. It was not until an hour had passed that Mrs Ross was finally assessed by a doctor, who realised she had suffered a stroke and arranged for her to be taken to a stroke unit at Royal London Hospital. However, she never regained full consciousness and died two weeks later. Crucially, her oxygen levels were not checked until she was seen by the ambulance crew \\u2013 90 minutes after Mr Wilkins raised the alarm. They were found to be at a level where brain damage can set in. Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross and was put into special measures last month over a series of failings, has begun an investigation into the treatment of Mrs Ross. The nurses\\u2019 alleged inaction occurred despite the NHS\\u2019s own campaign \\u2013 launched six years ago \\u2013 that uses the acronym FAST, standing for Face, Arms, Speech, Time. People are told to call 999 \\u2018immediately\\u2019 if a suspected victim\\u2019s face has fallen on one side, they cannot raise their arms or if their speech is slurred. Describing her mother\\u2019s appearance after the stroke, Miss Ross said: \\u2018Although she opened her eyes, she could not communicate and became agitated with pain, so was on morphine. It was awful watching her like that. \\u2018There were at least four nurses on the ward at Whipps Cross but they didn\\u2019t do anything until I hit the roof. \\u2018My mother gave her working life to the NHS. Although she has shown early signs of dementia, she was still very much with it, still very quick apart from memory loss sometimes. Inquiry: Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross (above) and was put into special measures last month over a series of failings, has begun an investigation into the treatment of Mrs Ross . \\u2018What was killing me was wondering how long my mother had been there before Wayne saw her. She still recognised us when I got to Whipps Cross so she must have been wondering why nobody was coming to help her. I want other people to be aware of what happened and for the hospital to make sure it never happens again.\\u2019 Mrs Ross, a widow with four grandchildren and a great-grandchild, was being looked after by her daughter at home but was admitted to Whipps Cross after developing a urinary infection. She suffered the stroke on Sunday, March 22 and died in the Royal London on April 2. Her case comes after Barts Health Trust was put into special measures by the Care Quality Commission watchdog last month due to a catalogue of failings at Whipps Cross. A Barts Health NHS Trust spokesman said: \\u2018We are extremely concerned to learn of the issues raised by the family of Mrs Ross. We will be conducting an investigation.\\u2019\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hollie Tillbrook's heart momentarily stopped after she fainted in Basildon .\\nBut two nearby officers thought to be from the Met rushed to give her CPR .\\nMother Denise Bennett was told to expect worst, but Hollie unexpectedly woke up from her induced coma .\\nThe family now want to try and find the off-duty officers who saved her life .\",\n          \"eO PP03 runs on 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that drives six motors .\\nIt produces 1020 kW (1368 horsepower) and has a peak torque of\\u00a02160 Nm .\\nCar will compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in Colorado .\",\n          \"Gloria Ross was found with a distorted face when grandson visited her .\\nHe raised alarm with nurses at Whipps Cross Hospital, North East London .\\nBut they said she was \\u2018just tired\\u2019 and that senior nurse was \\u2018on a break\\u2019\\nLater discovered she'd had stroke - and she never regained consciousness .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Ibrox interim chairman confirmed the terms of the initial \\u00a35million loan taken from Sports Direct by the previous hierarchy means Ashley retains the right to appoint directors. Murray insists Rangers now have no need for any further money from the Newcastle United owner, having this week instead secured a \\u00a31.5m loan from the Three Bears consortium to cover short-term needs. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley holds an eight per cent stake in Rangers and loaned the club \\u00a35m . However, he hopes to have talks with Ashley once a wider review of existing commercial deals with Sports Direct \\u2013 who own 75 per cent of the club\\u2019s retail subsidiary \\u2013 is complete. \\u2018We\\u2019ve had no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct so far but, as we have said before, we are happy to engage with them and feel we should do,\\u2019 Murray told Rangers TV. \\u2018They are an eight per cent shareholder and have financial arrangements with the club. We need to have that conversation pretty soon, but as yet we\\u2019ve had no discussions with them. \\u2018Mike Ashley does have the right to nominate two board members. It would be to the main public company, the International Football Club, and he has got rights under the first \\u00a35m loan to do that. \\u2018He\\u2019s showed no intention of doing it so far but he has the right to do it if he wants to - and we\\u2019d have to address that if and when he chooses to do that. Interim chairman Paul Murray (left) will have discussions with Ashley about his involvement at Ibrox . \\u2018I think, as Dave King was saying, one of the big information-gathering exercises was to look at the whole relationship between Sports Direct and the club. \\u2018There are a lot of relationships and there is a lot of documentation to go with those and we have spent the last three weeks looking at all of that. \\u2018We haven\\u2019t finished that review yet. I think once we have done that we will sit down, hopefully with Sports Direct and Mike Ashley, and try and agree a way forward.\\u2019 King has held off from becoming a director but intends to step into the chairman\\u2019s role providing he passes the SFA\\u2019s 'fit and proper\\u2019 person test. \\u2018The processes regarding both mine and Dave\\u2019s fit and proper persons test are pretty advanced,\\u2019 added Murray. Prospective chairman Dave King (right) has to pass the\\u00a0SFA\\u2019s \\u2018fit and proper\\u2019 person test . \\u2018We have said, and we will honour the fact, that we want to rebuild the relationship with all the governing bodies and we have to respect their processes and procedures.\\u2019 Murray also insisted he wants to help build a \\u2018modern Rangers upon traditional foundations\\u2019. He said: \\u2018People have spoken about having Rangers men on the board and getting back to a Rangers way of doing things but I think we also need to be a bit more forward-thinking. \\u2018I am looking a lot at this moment at the structure of various clubs and trying to get a sense of what would work at Rangers because there are different structures around Europe and even in Britain. \\u2018For example, the structure at Barcelona might not be appropriate for the structure at Rangers and we need to look at that kind of thing.\\u2019\",\n          \"Sam Allardyce believes a lack of winter break is hampering Premier League clubs in European competition. Chelsea were eliminated from the round of 32 in the Champions League by Paris St Germain on away goals on Wednesday night - whilst Manchester City and Arsenal both need to turn around first-leg defeats to Barcelona and Monaco, respectively if they are to advance. Liverpool and Tottenham have been knocked out of the Europa League with only Everton still standing and Allardyce feels a heavy festive schedule always catches English clubs out. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says Premier League clubs are suffering in Europe because of no winter break . Chelsea were dumped out of the Champions League on Wednesday night by Paris Saint-Germain . Thiago Silva's (right) extra-time header meant the French giants went through 3-3 on away goals . 'I think, like I have before, that we don't help ourselves with our fixture list,' the West Ham boss said. 'Playing as many games as we do through Christmas and New Year and not having the opportunity to shut the league down for a few weeks gives every club that plays in Europe a disadvantage. 'When they come back to playing in Europe they may have a considerable amount of injures in certain areas and mental fatigue kicks in on players - that is bound to have an effect when other teams have had the opportunity to take a break.' Swansea boss Garry Monk hailed the entertainment level of the Premier League but believes English clubs still lack the tactical nous of their continental counterparts. Everton are the only Premier League club still standing in the Europa League . Swansea boss Garry Monk says Premier League clubs should be doing better in Europe . 'I've always said the Premier League is the best league in the world but more so for entertainment rather than technical and tactical situations in countries like Spain,' he said. 'The Premier League is the best league in that it is the most entertaining, highest tempo, most ferocious and so much happens. 'Whether we need to improve on the tactical I'm not sure but we've got some of the best managers in the world in this league. 'It is very fine margins at that level as games are won and lost by one or two moments in a game. 'Looking at those players in those Premier League teams you think they would do better in those competitions. So I'm not sure if it's one of those seasons or if there is a fundamental problem.'\",\n          \"In a season when Manchester United\\u2019s aspirations have been peeled away like layers of an onion, the only goal left is qualification for the Champions League. It is enough to make even the steadfast shed a tear. Thrashed in the Capital One Cup by League One MK Dons and dumped out of the FA Cup by one of their own, United were never even in the Premier League title race. Entry back into Europe\\u2019s elite competition would represent a positive campaign however. The minimal requirement, undoubtedly, but a mark of improvement nonetheless. Something to look forward to. Manchester United have not beaten a team in the top half of the Premier League since Liverpool in December . Failure to finish in the top four would be pretty disastrous though. Without the extra commitment of a European campaign and having held a healthy lead in this run at one stage, falling late would ask serious questions of Louis van Gaal. It would probably mean entry into the Europa League instead \\u2013 a nightmare scenario adding games in a competition United would rather avoid entirely. The continent\\u2019s purgatory. United face a difficult run-in, with 10 games to define their season. Four of their next five matches are against the top six but Van Gaal\\u2019s side have not beaten a team currently in the top half of the table since December. Here,Sportsmail assesses their chances. Man United vs Tottenham (March 15) Reverse fixture: 0-0 . A struggle for life, is how Van Gaal termed the second half of the sides\\u2019 dour draw at White Hart Lane on December 28. A repeat would be intolerable not only to watching fans but in the table. United must win, and beware Harry Kane. The 21-year-old striker already has 26 goals to his name this season - more than the supposedly stellar line-up of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao have managed for United combined. Besides, Mauricio Pochettino's men have Champions League ambitions of their own, and will be desperate for a victory over one of their chief rivals for the top four. Prediction: 2-1 United . Manchester United train ahead of their crunch Premier League clash against Tottenham on Sunday . Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao are all smiles despite their side's recent struggles . Football data analysts BSports believe a Manchester United home win is easily the most likely outcome . March 15: Tottenham (home) March 22: Liverpool (away) April 4: Aston Villa (home) April 12: Man City (home) April 18: Chelsea (away) April 26: Everton (away) May 2: West Brom (home) May 9: Crystal Palace (away) May 16: Arsenal (home) May 24: Hull (away) Liverpool vs Man United (March 22) Reverse fixture: 3-0 United . The match at Old Trafford sparked Liverpool\\u2019s remarkable resurgence into the Champions League hunt. This game could prove the deciding factor. Brendan Rodgers has his side buoyant and Anfield will be bouncing. Van Gaal should douse the flames with his selection. But, with Philippe Coutinho rampant, Raheem Sterling offering pace and dynamism simply not seen in United's team and Daniel Sturridge now back in action after injury,the Dutchman will need a tactical masterstroke to pull off victory. This is arguably the fiercest rivalry in the land as England's two most successful clubs go head-to-head. Anfield will be rocking with the added incentive that Van Gaal's head could be on the block if he fails to finish in the top four. Prediction: 1-1 . Man United vs Aston Villa (April 4) Reverse fixture: 1-1 . Tim Sherwood led Spurs to victory in his previous visit to Old Trafford as a manager, and Villa are showing signs of vibrancy under his charge. They need points for survival and will fight all the way for it. Surely United will have too much quality though. Could arguably be the easiest fixture in United's run-in. But, as we've seen these last two seasons, anything is possible in the post-Fergie era. Prediction: 2-0 United . Man United vs Man City (April 12) Reverse fixture: 1-0 City . Sergio Aguero got the decisive goal at the Etihad on an afternoon Chris Smalling lost his head and City were denied three clear penalties. Manuel Pellegrini\\u2019s team have not often been at their best since, but their firepower can be awesome when focused on the right target. Such as their biggest rivals. This will be a third Manchester derby at Old Trafford at this stage in three consecutive seasons. City have won the past two. 6-1, anyone? United have rarely got near their noisy neighbours in recent years. And City's focus could be entirely focused on overhauling Chelsea's Premier League lead after their likely Champions League elimination in Barcelona. But Old Trafford will not stand for their men surrendering as meekly as during last season's grim 3-0 defeat. Prediction: 1-1 . Sergio Aguero is likely to cause the United defence problems in next month's Manchester derby . Chelsea vs Man United (April 18) Reverse fixture: 1-1 . Robin van Persie\\u2019s late equalising goal got Old Trafford to its feet and hoping a turning point had been found. It proved to be a false dawn and Chelsea have eased away at the top. Out of Europe, Jose Mourinho\\u2019s side are unlikely to lose focus as their hunt for the title reaches its closing moments. Men like John Terry, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa will surely not let that happen, and the Blues' mixture of power, pace and potency should see them too good for United. PSG did, however, expose chinks in Chelsea's armour. Whether Angel Di Maria, Ashley Young et al are strong enough to pierce those gaps is another matter, . Prediction 2-1 Chelsea . Eden Hazard has been Chelsea's stand out player this season as they bid to recapture the title . Everton vs Man United (April 26) Reverse fixture: 2-1 United . Radamel Falcao appeared like a tiger to pounce for the winning goal at Old Trafford but the once-feared predator has experienced the wilderness since. Defeat at Goodison Park did for David Moyes last season although the ground does hold happier memories for United. But Everton are in a scrap themselves. Defeat this weekend and a victory for QPR or Burnley could leave Roberto Martinez's men just three points off the dreaded drop zone. Surely that would be the wake-up call Everton need to spark their season into life at long last. Prediction: 1-1 . Romelu Lukaku could cause United problems if he can carry his European form into the Premier League . Man United vs West Brom (May 2) Reverse fixture: 2-2 . Twice United came from behind to salvage a point at the Hawthorns, with Daley Blind\\u2019s measured effort the point-clincher. West Brom are a tougher nut to crack these days under Tony Pulis but the need for victory will weigh heavy on the hosts. The Baggies were also one of the teams to spring a shock at Old Trafford last season, when Saido Berahino and Morgan Amalfitano stunned David Moyes. Expect Berahino to score at Old Trafford again, but United to have the edge with more to play for than their visitors. Prediction: 2-1 United . Tony Pulis has transformed West Brom's fortunes and his side will be a stern test for United in May . Crystal Palace vs Man United (May 9) Reverse fixture: 1-0 United . Juan Mata, remember him? The Spaniard popped up for the winner in the season\\u2019s earlier game, an example of United at their most stubborn - performing poorly but still grinding out a win. Another illustration at Selhurst Park would do just fine. But that is easier said than done, with Alan Pardew having galvanised Palace since his return to Selhurst Park. Silencing the Eagles' ferocious home support in a big game towards the end of the season is no easy task - just ask Liverpool. But surely Van Gaal can squeeze a win here. Prediction: 1-0 United . Juan Mata scored the only goal of the game when United hosted Crystal Palace earlier in the season . Man United vs Arsenal (May 16) Reverse fixture: 2-1 United . A smash and grab to make John Dillinger blush, United stole three points from the Emirates in a game they ought to have lost. Angel Di Maria and Wayne Rooney showed a fleeting impression of understanding too. Arsenal have since shown that they know how to win at Old Trafford, thanks to the Danny Welbeck-inspired win in the FA Cup on Monday in which United struggled to get break down their opponents and were outfought as well as out-thought. But Monday's FA Cup defeat has pained United. That Welbeck was the man to deliver the knockout blow stings even more. Expect revenge. Prediction: 2-1 United . Danny Welbeck scored the winner as Arsenal dumped United out of the FA Cup earlier this week . Hull vs Man United (May 24) Reverse fixture: 3-0 United . The last time United visited the KC Stadium on the final day Sir Alex Ferguson fielded an inexperienced side having wrapped up the title and with a Champions League final against Barcelona on the horizon. How times have changed. Steve Bruce\\u2019s side could be safe by then and less motivated. But if they're not, this fixture becomes loaded full of danger - for both sides. You would back the United of old to win this encounter every time, but can you say the same about Van Gaal's version? Prediction: 1-0 United . Total predicted points: 74. United won the title with just one point more in 1996/97 but the parameters have shifted since then. Last year under Moyes they finished seventh on 64 points, while Arsenal came fourth on 79. Close call on whether 74 would be enough this time.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Rangers took a \\u00a35million loan from Sports Direct to help cover costs .\\nAs part of agreement Mike Ashley can name two board members at Ibrox .\\nRangers took \\u00a31.5m loan from Three Bears consortium earlier this week .\\nInterim chairman Paul Murray will have discussions with Ashley .\",\n          \"Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League last 16 by PSG .\\nManchester City and Arsenal are both trailing in their knockout ties .\\nLiverpool and Tottenham\\u00a0were both exited the Europa League round of 32 .\\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Premier League news .\",\n          \"Manchester United's only remaining goal is to finish in the top four .\\nThe club have been absent from European competition this season .\\nBut Louis van Gaal's side face four of the top six in their next five games .\\nUnited have not beaten a top-half Premier League side since December .\\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
